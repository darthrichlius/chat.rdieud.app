# CHAT

[APP_NAME] is a multi-modal instant messaging service powered by AI.

## FEATURES

It allows users to exchange and communicate with each other through **Direct Messages** (one-to-one channel) or **group channels**.

### Main Features

Communication is established primarily through text and voice messages. Users can also exchange images, documents, music files, and even rich-data like location.

### Additional Features

Additionally, to its conventional features, [APP_NAME] offers two cool and useful features:

#### (1) Chatbot powered by AI

This is something similar to popular products like "ChatGPT", "Gemini", or "MistralAI Chat", but with an **enhanced user experience**.

#### (2) Monolog chat

A useful feature helpful to empty your mind and easily set reminders. As the product is cross-platform, and data are stored in the cloud, you can manage your notes even from your phone.

Some of the features might be missing at the moment of writing. The features displayed are part of the global vision and long-term roadmap.

Part of the codebase is private, which means the **application can't run without you building your own backend infrastructure**.
